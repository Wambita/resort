<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is probably the most reclusive island escape out there – and yet also the most indulgent, too. A place where it feels like you’re the only people on the planet but a Daiquiri is only a wave of the hand away. The geography of Gladden is what hooked in owner Chris Krolow: two mangrove-ringed islets, one in front of the other, a half-hour chopper ride from Belize City over the western hemisphere’s largest barrier reef. Krolow has placed a single villa on the first island and tucked the staff onto the second. Guests are left deliciously alone on their little Robinson Crusoe dot to mooch around the sleek, Mayan-inspired house, stretch out on a day bed by the pool or take a dip in the turquoise water. But the chef, manager and concierge are less than a two-minute boat ride away. There’s a privacy light that signals if the housekeeper has popped in to make up the room, the spa therapist is setting up for a massage in the palapa or a barbecue is being lit for a supper of chargrilled lobster and salad from the garden. From the roof terrace, the Maya Mountains shimmer in the distance and all around the island is calm blue. This is in a protected marine reserve, with whale sharks and pods of dolphins. The boat captain can organise mainland excursions (shopping in Placencia, a tour of the Mayan ruins), but the most sensible thing to do is just stay put. Until Leonardo di Caprio opens Blackadore Caye in Belize later this year, this is Central America’s shiniest island hideout.</p>
